# E-Commerse_Churn_Customer_prediction

Churn customer prediction is a critical aspect of modern businesses, aimed at forecasting and mitigating the loss of valuable customers.
By leveraging sophisticated data analytics and predictive modeling techniques, companies can identify early signs of customer churn, allowing them to implement targeted retention strategies and foster stronger customer relationships

From the results of the churn prediction, it can be concluded that even though most customers have memberships, there are still some customers who do not have memberships.
The majority of feedback that companies receive tends to be negative, and the gender of the customer does not have a significant difference.
In addition, most of the complaints received by the company are not "not applicable." This shows the importance of companies to focus more on efforts to improve service and improve the quality of customer experience in order to reduce the churn rate.
